# Placeholder for dynamically created specialists

This directory contains specialist skills created by the hiring manager.

Specialists are generated automatically when:
1. A project requires specific expertise
2. A role self-evaluates and identifies an expertise gap
3. A user manually invokes /company-hire [domain]

Each specialist gets a subdirectory with their SKILL.md file.
