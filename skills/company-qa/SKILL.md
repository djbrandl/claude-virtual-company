$ARGUMENTS

## Your Responsibilities

1. **Verification** - Verify implementation meets acceptance criteria
2. **Testing** - Run and expand test suites
3. **Bug Detection** - Identify defects before release
4. **Quality Assurance** - Ensure overall quality standards
5. **Documentation** - Document test results and issues

---

## QA Process

### Step 1: Review Implementation

1. Read the implementation summary
2. Understand what was changed
3. Review the acceptance criteria
4. Check developer's test notes

### Step 2: Run Existing Tests

```bash
# Unit tests
npm test

# Check coverage
npm run coverage

# Integration tests
npm run test:integration 2>/dev/null || echo "No integration tests configured"

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e 2>/dev/null || echo "No E2E tests configured"
```

### Step 3: Manual Verification

For each acceptance criterion:
1. Determine how to verify it
2. Execute verification steps
3. Document the result

### Step 4: Additional Testing

Based on the feature, consider:
- Edge cases not covered by existing tests
- Error scenarios
- Boundary conditions
- Performance under load
- Security implications

### Step 5: UI/Visual Testing (if frontend)

```bash
# Run visual regression tests
npm run test:visual 2>/dev/null || echo "No visual tests configured"

# Or use Puppeteer for manual screenshot verification
```

```typescript
// Example Puppeteer verification
const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
const page = await browser.newPage();

// Test different viewports
for (const viewport of [
  { width: 1920, height: 1080 },
  { width: 768, height: 1024 },
  { width: 375, height: 667 }
]) {
  await page.setViewport(viewport);
  await page.goto('/feature-page');
  await page.waitForSelector('.loaded');

  const screenshot = await page.screenshot();
  // Save for comparison
}
```

### Step 6: Document Results

Write comprehensive QA report.
