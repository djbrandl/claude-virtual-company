# Project Progress

Check current state and route to next action.

## Context Loading

Before analyzing progress, load the following:

1. **Current State**: Read the last 30 lines of `.planning/STATE.md`. If missing, PM needs to be initialized with `/company-init-pm`
2. **Roadmap Status**: Read `.planning/ROADMAP.md` if it exists
3. **Phase Artifacts**: List contents of `.planning/phase-*/` directories to see what phases exist and their contents
4. **Git Status**: Run `git status --short` (first 20 lines)
5. **Task List**: Run `TaskList()` to see current tasks
6. **Historical Context** (if claude-mem available): Query relevant observations

---

## Claude-Mem Integration (Optional)

If claude-mem is installed, use its MCP tools to enrich context:

### Check for Recent Issues
```
Use MCP tool: search
Query: "bug OR error OR fix OR issue" for current project/phase
```

### Retrieve Testing Feedback
```
Use MCP tool: search
Query: "test OR testing OR verification" + current phase name
Then: timeline to see chronological context
Then: get_observations for full details on relevant IDs
```

### Pattern Recognition
Search for recurring themes that may not be in formal handoffs:
- UI/UX feedback: "alignment OR spacing OR layout"
- Performance issues: "slow OR timeout OR performance"
- Integration problems: "API OR integration OR connection"

**Fallback**: If claude-mem is not available, skip this section and proceed with file-based context only. The skill works fully without it.

## Progress Analysis

Based on state and artifacts, determine:

1. **Current Phase**: What phase are we in?
2. **Phase Status**:
   - Not started (no CONTEXT.md)
   - Discussed (has CONTEXT.md, no PLAN.md)
   - Planned (has PLAN.md, no SUMMARY.md)
   - Executed (has SUMMARY.md, no VERIFICATION.md)
   - Verified (has VERIFICATION.md + UAT.md)
   - Complete (phase marked done in ROADMAP.md)

3. **Blockers**: Any open blockers in STATE.md?

4. **Next Action**: Route to appropriate command

---

## Routing Logic

```
If no .planning/ exists:
  → /company-init-pm

If no PROJECT.md:
  → /company-new-project

If current phase has no CONTEXT.md:
  → /company-discuss {phase}

If current phase has CONTEXT.md but no PLAN.md:
  → /company-plan-phase {phase}

If current phase has PLAN.md but no SUMMARY.md:
  → /company-execute {phase}

If current phase has SUMMARY.md but no VERIFICATION.md:
  → /company-verify {phase}

If current phase verified:
  → Mark complete, advance to next phase
  → If all phases complete: /company-milestone
```

## Output Format

```markdown
# Project Progress

## Project
{Project name from PROJECT.md}

## Milestone
{Current milestone from ROADMAP.md}

## Phase Status
| Phase | Name | Status | Progress |
|-------|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Foundation | complete | ✓ |
| 2 | Core Features | executing | 2/3 plans |
| 3 | Integration | pending | — |
| 4 | Polish | pending | — |

## Current Phase
**Phase 2: Core Features**
- Status: Executing
- Plans: 2 of 3 complete
- Blockers: None

## Recent Activity
{Last 5 entries from STATE.md session log}

## Open Tasks
{From TaskList()}

## ▶ What's Next?

**Recommended:** `{command}` — {description}

| Other Options | Command | When to use |
|---------------|---------|-------------|
| Report issue | `/company-reply "..."` | Found a bug or have feedback |
| Ad-hoc task | `/company-quick "..."` | Quick fix outside current phase |
| Check status | `/company-status` | See detailed workflow state |
| Pause work | `/company-pause` | Need to stop for now |
```
